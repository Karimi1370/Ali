This README is used to document the project about the digitalization of a health insurance application process. 

To have a picture of the current situation, a high level AS-IS process is created with BPMN 2.0. Together with the decision table, this AS-IS process is allready executable but requires a lot of human interaction. To reduce human tasks, the process is then digitalized and every step of digitalization is documented.
